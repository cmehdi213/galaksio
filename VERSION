- Now the panel showing the current invocation state shows also the state for each step in the workflow. Besides the results for the workflow execution are always shown even if the workflow failed. Additionally, the user can get more details for each step in the workflow and see the used parameters and other useful information (Issue #13 and #28).
- Added a more developed method for form validation. Now erroneous fields are indicated at the top of the form and at the right of each invalid input with a red exclamation symbol. Besides, the application will autofocus the first invalid field (Issue #10 and #14).

- Upgraded the version of "AngularJS dialogs" library to support the Report button handler (Issue #12).
- Added settings to configure a SMTP server in Galaksio and send the error report via email to the developers account. Alternatively, if not SMTP settings are provided, the report is forwarded to a main Galaksio server which will send the report by email (Issue #12).
- Fixed some visual issues (Issue #17).
- Display step name (if any) in data and data collection inputs (Issue #16).
- Added +/- zoom button in workflow diagram, now mouse wheel is used only for scrolling (Issue #18).
