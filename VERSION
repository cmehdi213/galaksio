- Now the panel showing the current invocation state shows also the state for each step in the workflow. Besides the results for the workflow execution are always shown even if the workflow failed. Additionally, the user can get more details for each step in the workflow and see the used parameters and other useful information (Issue #13 and #28).

- Added settings to configure a SMTP server in Galaksio and send the error report via email to the developers account. Alternatively, if not SMTP settings are provided, the report is forwarded to a main Galaksio server which will send the report by email (Issue #12).
- Fixed some visual issues (Issue #17).
- Display step name (if any) in data and data collection inputs (Issue #16).
- Added +/- zoom button in workflow diagram, now mouse wheel is used only for scrolling (Issue #18).
- Added affix support to history list, now the left panel scrolls down following the window (Issue #20).
- Replaced yes/no checkboxes by 2 state button (Issue #22).
- Replaced radio buttons by a drop-down menu (Issue #23).
- Replaced multi-select fields by list of checkboxes (Issue #24).

## Paired Reads Support Details

### Supported Sequencing Platforms
- **Illumina**: All Illumina sequencing platforms with standard R1/R2 or _1/_2 naming
- **PacBio**: Single-molecule real-time sequencing with forward/reverse designation
- **Oxford Nanopore**: Long-read sequencing with forward/reverse paired reads
- **Ion Torrent**: Semiconductor sequencing with standard paired-end naming
- **Custom Platforms**: Configurable pattern recognition for custom naming conventions

### Supported File Formats
- **FASTQ**: `.fastq`, `.fq`, `.fastq.gz`, `.fq.gz`
- **FASTA**: `.fasta`, `.fa`, `.fas`, `.fasta.gz`, `.fa.gz`, `.fas.gz`
- **Alignment**: `.bam`, `.sam`

### Detection Patterns
| Pattern Type | Example Forward | Example Reverse | Confidence Boost |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Illumina R1/R2 | `sample_R1.fastq` | `sample_R2.fastq` | High |
| Illumina 1/2 | `sample_1.fastq` | `sample_2.fastq` | High |
| Read Number | `sample.read1.fastq` | `sample.read2.fastq` | Medium |
| Dot Notation | `sample.R1.fastq` | `sample.R2.fastq` | Medium |
| Directional | `sample_forward.fastq` | `sample_reverse.fastq` | Medium |

### Confidence Scoring Algorithm
The paired reads detection uses a multi-factor confidence scoring system:

- **Pattern Match**: 40% for standard patterns (R1/R2, _1/_2)
- **File Size Similarity**: 30% based on size ratio between paired files
- **Data Type Match**: 20% for identical data types
- **Name Consistency**: 10% for consistent base naming

**Confidence Levels:**
- **High (0.8-1.0)**: Automatic collection creation recommended
- **Medium (0.6-0.79)**: Manual review recommended
- **Low (0.0-0.59)**: Unlikely to be true pairs

### API Endpoints for Paired Reads
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/detect_paired_reads` | POST | Detect paired reads in a history |
| `/api/create_paired_collection` | POST | Create Galaxy collection from paired reads |
| `/api/auto_pair_all_reads` | POST | Auto-pair all reads in history |
| `/api/get_paired_read_patterns` | GET | Get supported patterns and formats |
